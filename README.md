Real Estate Price Prediction üè†
This project is a step-by-step guide to building a real estate price prediction website. Using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, we first develop a predictive model with sklearn and linear regression, then deploy it using Python Flask as a backend server, and finally create a user-friendly HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end.

Project Workflow üåü
1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building:
-Build a Linear Regression model using the dataset.
-Cover key data science concepts, including:
-Data loading and cleaning
-Outlier detection and removal
-Feature engineering
-Dimensionality reduction
-Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
-K-Fold Cross Validation

2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Development:
-Create a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests.
-Save the trained model and use it to serve predictions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Development:

-Develop a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-Allow users to input parameters (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, etc.).
-Integrate the website with the Flask server to display predicted prices dynamically.
